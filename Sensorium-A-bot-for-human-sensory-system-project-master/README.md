Sensorium-A-bot-for-human-sensory-system-project

Created a prototype of a integrated system that can speak and listen, detect and classify objects, smell gases and sense temperature by establishing contact i.e. it replicates the processes of the human brain in co-ordinating these senses. 
Object detection was done using deep learning i.e. Tensor Flow (Transfer Learning), smell detection, temperature and contact was done using Raspberry pi and sensors and speech recognition using Natural Language Processing (NLTK) and Google Speech API
